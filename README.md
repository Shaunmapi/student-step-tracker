# Student Step Tracker

This project simulates and tracks daily step counts for 15 participants over 14 days based on their fitness levels (0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high). The script generates realistic step counts, calculates averages, medians, identifies top performers, and provides daily and percentile analysis.

## Features

- Randomly assign fitness levels to participants
- Generate 14 days of step counts per participant
- Clip step counts to realistic values (3000–15000)
- Calculate average and median steps per participant
- Identify top 5 participants by average steps
- Identify participants with highest and lowest median steps
- Calculate mean steps per day
- Count participants with average steps above 8000
- Show 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of all steps

## How to Run
